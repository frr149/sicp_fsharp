== Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs in F#

As an excercise in the fundamentals of functional programming and as a way to get more 
accustomed to F# and Visual Studio 2008, I will be following the 1986 lecture series 
based on MIT course 6.001 "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs," but I will
be programming with F#.

The original text is available at http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html
The lectures are available at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/

I hope to get through the entire series before my 90-day trial of Visual Studio runs out...
