Lecture 2b
In which Dr. Abelson contracts with George to come in and discuss abstractions.

2  Building Abstractions with Data

Data Abstractions exist the exact same way that method abstractions do.  By combining
primitive data types into compound data types, we can implement more interesting
and advanced functionality.


2.1  Introduction to Data Abstraction

2.1.1  Example: Arithmetic Operations for Rational Numbers

Imagining that structures exist for rational numbers, we imagine how arithmetic might
be implemented.

In lisp the structure is a list.  In F#, we have the ability to implement the structure
as a list or as a tuple set or as a more advanced Object.

Or like in scheme using simple closures...
let cons a b = function
    | 1 -> a
    | 0 -> b
let car p = p 1
let cdr p = p 0
